# Wine-Quality classification using Deep Learning

 Implemented a classification model for the classification of red wine.

 Performed outlier’s handling treatment, EDA, preprocessing, correlation, and created a heat map.

 Built a Neural network model for various optimizers, activation functions, kernel initializers, cross entropies with n number of layers. Created a confusion matrix for the results obtained. The best accuracy obtained for the model was 82.3%.
